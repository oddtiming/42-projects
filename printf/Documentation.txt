- printf

- "-0." flags :
	- "-" : A negative field width flag; the converted value is to be left adjusted
			on the field boundary.  Except for n conversions, the converted value is
			padded on the right with blanks, rather than on the left with blanks or
			zeros.  A - overrides a 0 if both are given.
	- '0' : Zero padding.  For all conversions except n, the converted value is
			padded on the left with zeros rather than blanks.  If a precision is
			given with a numeric conversion (d, i, o, u, i, x, and X), the 0 flag is
			ignored.
	- '.' :	An optional precision, in the form of a period . followed by an optional digit
			string.  If the digit string is omitted, the precision is taken as zero.  This gives
			the minimum number of digits to appear for d, i, o, u, x, and X conversions, the num-
			ber of digits to appear after the decimal-point for a, A, e, E, f, and F conversions,
			the maximum number of significant digits for g and G conversions, or the maximum num-
			ber of characters to be printed from a string for s conversions.

- VA_ARG (STDARG)

NOTES:
- list of proceeding :
	- Set up va_arg, play with it a bit
	- set up % conversions ; best way to see if my function works at all
	- do individual conversions for eah variable type
	- Set up flag conversions; 
		- "-0." must be used in conjuncture
		- " ", "+", "#" must be used separately
	- Implement a static (global?) variable to count the amount of characters printed; 
		alternatively could convert to a string before outputting and simply counting the resulting string ; might be safer.
